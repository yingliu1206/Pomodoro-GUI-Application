# Pomodoro-GUI-Application
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It encourages people to work with the time they have, rather than against it. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This method enhances focus and productivity, reducing mental fatigue.

## Overview

This program utilizes the Python module Tkinter to create a user-friendly graphical interface. The Pomodoro GUI Application is designed to help users manage their time effectively by following the Pomodoro Technique.

### Key Components
* Tkinter: The core library for building the GUI.
* Window: The main application window that hosts all components.
* Label: Displays the current timer status and prompts to the user.
* Button: Interactive elements to start and reset the timer.

### Features
* 25-Minute Work Sessions: The application prompts you to work for 25 minutes.
* 5-Minute Short Breaks: After each work session, enjoy a 5-minute break to recharge.
* 20-Minute Long Break: After completing four work sessions, you can take a longer break.
* Start Button: Click the "Start" button to begin your work session countdown.
* Automatic Transition: The timer automatically transitions from work sessions to breaks.
* Reset Button: You can reset the timer at any time to start over.
